This folder contains images for blog posts. Make sure to include a normal size (800x400) and thumbnail version (250x125). Use a short and descriptive file name and suffix the thumbnail version with -tn.<br/>
For example:<br/>
sunrise.png<br/>
sunrise-tn.png

In the yaml config of the blog post refer to the images without using the path and use 'img' and 'tn'.<br/>
For example:<br/>
img: sunrise.png<br/>
tn: sunrise-tn.png
